# AI-Implementations
Neural Network classification programs that classify types of penguins based on their features.

Part1 Uses a Multilayered Neural Network.

Part2 Uses a Evolutionairy Computation Genetic program that formulates a model that matches the training data and can then be applied to unseen data
to classify it.
